# Deployment Summary

## Issue Fixed

During deployment, the Laravel migration process failed with the error:
```
SQLSTATE[42701]: Duplicate column: 7 ERROR:  column "sslrequired" of relation "import_d_b_s" already exists
```

This occurred because the new migration `2025_03_11_150811_add_sslrequired_to_import_d_b_s_table.php` was trying to add a column that was already created by a previous migration `2024_09_23_104924_add_column_sslrequired_to_import_d_b_s_table`.

## Solution Applied

1. Created a file `fix_duplicate_migration.ps1` to:
   - Modify the migration file to check if the column exists before adding it
   - Run the migration safely
   - Verify migration status after completion

2. Applied the fix by:
   - Running `.\fix_duplicate_migration.ps1`
   - Confirming the migration is now marked as complete

3. Applied additional fixes from the update:
   - CSRF issues fixed with `.\fix_csrf_issues.ps1`
   - Font issues fixed with `.\fix_fonts.ps1`
   - Session store fixed with `.\fix_session_store.ps1`
   - Blade template updated with `.\update-blade-template.ps1`
   - Built frontend assets with `npm run build`

## Verification

All scripts completed successfully and the application should now be deployable without errors.

## Next Steps

1. Continue with the original deployment script
2. Start the Laravel application with `php artisan serve`
3. Verify that the application functions correctly in a browser
